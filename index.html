	<p class="intro_paragraph">HTML5 stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, the 5 means it is the 5th version of HTML. One of HTML5's main goals is to improve browser, computer, and human readability. But another goal of HTML5 is to improve support for the latest multimedia. HTML5 has many goals and is still in development it will continue to be developed for many years to come. It has the ability to use apps even when the browser isn't connected to the internet. This is because HTML5 also utilizes better local storage so apps can be stored locally on your computer. Better connections for gaming with socket based networking. </p><p class="column">HTML5 also works great with CSS3 to bring your pages to life. HTML5 has also added new tags for greater semantics so browser, developer, computer, and user know whats happening. Even with all these new features HTML5 has it does not sacrifice speed or performance, even with all the new features HTML 5 is actually faster than ever. HTML5 will become even more stable and useful over time.</p>
